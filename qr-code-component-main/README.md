## Overview
This project is a solution to the QR Code Component Challenge from Frontend Mentor. The goal was to build a simple, responsive card component featuring a QR code, allowing users to scan and access a given link.
Through this challenge, I practiced HTML and CSS fundamentals, focusing on responsive design, flexbox, and alignment techniques.

## My process
1. Planning & Understanding the Challenge
I started by carefully reviewing the Frontend Mentor challenge brief and analyzing the provided Figma design.
I noted down the key elements needed: the QR code, the text, and the container styling.

2. Setting Up the Project
I created a new GitHub repository and cloned it to my local machine.
I structured my project with the following folders:

/qr-code-component
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── images/
├── README.md

I linked my CSS file to the HTML file and ensured the project was set up correctly.
3. Writing the HTML Structure
I used semantic HTML5 to structure the page.
I wrapped the QR code and text inside a container div for better styling.

4. Styling with CSS
I applied CSS Flexbox to center the component on the page.
I used Google Fonts (Outfit) to match the design.
I set the correct font sizes, colors, and spacing based on the design.
I adjusted the background color and added a subtle shadow to the QR code container.

5. Making the Design Responsive
I used a mobile-first approach, ensuring the design looked great on smaller screens first.
I tested the layout by resizing my browser window and using Chrome Developer Tools.

6. Deploying the Project
I pushed my code to GitHub and deployed it using GitHub Pages.
I tested the Live Site URL on both desktop and mobile to ensure everything looked correct.


## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 for styling
- Flexbox for layout alignment
- Git & GitHub for version control and deployment
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- VS Code as the code editor

## What I learned
During this project, I gained a better understanding of:

CSS Flexbox for centering elements and layout control.
How to use Google Fonts to enhance typography.
The importance of consistent padding and margin for proper spacing.
How to deploy a project on GitHub Pages for live hosting.
Here’s an example of CSS I used that I’m proud of:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  background-color: white;
  padding: 20px;
  box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

## Continued development

Going forward, I want to focus on:

Learning CSS Grid to complement my knowledge of Flexbox.
Improving my HTML accessibility by using ARIA attributes properly.
Practicing more Frontend Mentor challenges to build my skills.

## Useful resources
